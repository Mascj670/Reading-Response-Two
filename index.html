    <h2>Reading Response</h2>
    <div class="response">
        <p>The digital realm, as explored in "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge," offers a unique canvas for creators. The duality of a website being both a subject and an object emphasizes the intricate relationship between its form and function. As both the storyteller and the builder of the story's environment, a website creator has the power to shape the narrative and the space it inhabits. This dual role allows for a harmonious blend of design aesthetics and content, ensuring that the website remains a genuine reflection of the creator's intent.
        Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of individuality in shaping the web's future. In an era dominated by corporate interests, the vitality of the web hinges on the contributions of individual creators. Their genuine expressions breathe life into the vast network, ensuring that the web remains a space for authentic voices and not just commercial agendas.
        Artists, with their innate ability to create worlds, find in websites a platform that amplifies their creative expression. Websites, being living and temporal spaces, evolve with the artist's journey, reflecting their growth, experiences, and emotions. They are not just archives but dynamic digital canvases that capture the essence of the artist's world. In conclusion, the article beautifully encapsulates the poetic potential of websites. 
        In the hands of genuine creators, websites transcend their digital confines, becoming living embodiments of ideas, emotions, and narratives.</p>
